The Nyra SD-JWT SDK is split into a few cohesive namespaces:

| Namespace | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `Nyra\SdJwt\Issuer` | Create SD-JWT credentials and disclosures. |
| `Nyra\SdJwt\Holder` | Drive selective disclosure decisions and optional key binding. |
| `Nyra\SdJwt\Verification` | Validate presentations, disclosures, and key bindings. |
| `Nyra\SdJwt\Support` | Helpers such as base64url utilities and JWK conversion. |
| `Nyra\SdJwt\Exception` | Exception hierarchy used across the library. |

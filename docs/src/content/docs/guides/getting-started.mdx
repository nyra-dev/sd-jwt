Welcome! This chapter assumes you have experience with PHP but are new to the **Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT)** specification. We will cover core vocabulary before generating your first credential.

## What is SD-JWT?

SD-JWTs extend regular JSON Web Tokens with two important ideas:

- **Disclosures** – Encrypted snippets that contain claim values and a per-claim salt.
- **Digests** – Hashes of those disclosures stored in the issuer-signed payload so verifiers can later match disclosures against the original credential.

This lets a holder share *only* the claims needed for a transaction without reissuing the credential.

## Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1 or newer
- Composer
- Optional: Git for version control

## Installation

Create a project folder and install the package via Composer:

```bash
mkdir sd-jwt-demo && cd sd-jwt-demo
composer init --name="demo/sd-jwt-demo" --require="nyra/sd-jwt:^1.0" -n
composer install
```

Alternatively, add the dependency to an existing `composer.json`:

```bash
composer require nyra/sd-jwt
```

## Project structure

The library is namespaced under `Nyra\SdJwt`. These are the main entry points you will frequently use:

| Purpose | Class |
| ------- | ----- |
| Issue credentials | `Nyra\SdJwt\Issuer\SdJwtIssuer` |
| Drive a wallet/holder | `Nyra\SdJwt\Holder\SdJwtHolder` |
| Verify presentations | `Nyra\SdJwt\Verification\SdJwtVerifier` |

## Minimal hello world

The following script issues a credential with one selectively disclosable claim, chooses disclosures as a holder, and verifies the presentation.

```php
<?php

require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

use Nyra\SdJwt\Claim\SdClaim;
use Nyra\SdJwt\Issuer\IssuerOptions;
use Nyra\SdJwt\Issuer\SdJwtIssuer;
use Nyra\SdJwt\Jwt\FirebaseJwtSigner;
use Nyra\SdJwt\Holder\SdJwtHolder;
use Nyra\SdJwt\Verification\SdJwtVerifier;
use Nyra\SdJwt\Jwt\FirebaseJwtVerifier;
use Firebase\JWT\Key;

$issuer = new SdJwtIssuer(new FirebaseJwtSigner('issuer-secret', 'HS256'));
$claims = [
    'iss' => 'https://issuer.example',
    'given_name' => 'Alice',
    'family_name' => SdClaim::disclose('Walker'),
];

$issued = $issuer->issue($claims, new IssuerOptions(headers: ['typ' => 'vc+sd-jwt']));

$holder = new SdJwtHolder($issued);
$presentation = $holder->buildPresentation(['family_name']);

$verifier = new SdJwtVerifier(new FirebaseJwtVerifier(new Key('issuer-secret', 'HS256')));
$result = $verifier->verify($presentation->toCompact());

print_r($result->payload());
```

Running the script prints the verified payload containing both the permanently revealed `given_name` and the selectively disclosed `family_name`.

Continue to the next chapter to learn how issuers control disclosures in more realistic credentials.
